There are only a few ones in the early playing but players can unlock the others by crystals.

## How to get in game

Amount of Blessing that the character has is unlimited in 1 game.

## How to unlock

- use crystal to unlock random blessing in the Mist Sanctuary

## How to enhance

- Use crystal to enhance blessing (level) permanently in The Mist Sanctuary

The Blessings have multiple enhance options every at 1 level, but can apply only 1 at each level.

!> Players can unlock other options even if they've already obtained an option in the level. When they do as, we should show warning modal dialog like "You can apply only 1 option in this level. Switching between options can only be done at the Sanctuary. Do you really want to unlock it? - Yes / No [ ] never show again".

## Ban Blessing

If amount of blessing is over 30, the feature "BAN" will be unlocked. To ban it, Players can push base (not enhance options) blessing icon even if ones are there from the beginning.
