Equipments have their own story, lore, and memory. Players can unlock them to modify the equipment.

## Implicit mod

Each equipment has its own implicit mod (: really powered mod).

Example:

|Equipment|Implicit Mod|Description|
|---------|------------|-----------|
|Ratlicolt Royal Dagger|The Blue Grass Garden|Non-Block skills have +12% to frequency. Block skills have -16% to frequency.|
|Ring of Eclipse|The Forgotten Sun|Fire skills never deal fire damage but have +100% to frequency.|
|Lanterns of the Mist Guides|Twilight|You cannot use block skill. Your Attack skill grants blocks of 30% potency.|

## Memory Depth

"Memory Depth" is the level of the equipments that shared between all of them.
Equipment has 3 normal slots and 3 _mist_ _slots_. Players can pay some crystals to level up resonance to unlock these slots.

## Normal Slot

Players can set equipment specific mods to the normal slots.

Example:

|Normal Mod|
|---------|
|60% Increased global damage|
|+50% chance to ignore cost of fire skills|

## Mist Slot

Players can set _mist mods_ to the _mist slots_. _Mist mods_ don't depend on equipments but have random values of property. The values can be reforged by Mist Orb.

Example:

|Mist Mods|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|_First Strike_|Trigger primary skill with _50~90_% less damage/block at battle start|
|_Harmonious Resonance_|Skills chain at least _1~3_ times.|
